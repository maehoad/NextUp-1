NextUp is a Hack112 (F18) project created by Diego San Miguel, Sean Prendi, Vignesh Rajmohan, and Mae Hoed

NextUp is meant to be a website that allows users to connect to a Spotify playlist and vote on what song they want next or add new songs
The website uses client data from the Spotify Developer website and Python scripts using the Spotipy module to complete this function
